# Proposal
Question: How do running trends correlate with weather or calendar trends?

Data to find: running data from different fitness apps, weather data for different regions (depending on how the fitness apps sort their data). We want to look for run time/session, run distance/session, frequency, number of users running.

The questions youâ€™ll ask of the data
Are there trends that follow local weather? Are there trends with calendar date (New Year's Resolutions, summer body, etc)
