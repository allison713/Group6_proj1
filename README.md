Question:
How does a CEO’s salary compare to the salary of an average employee within their company? Are there any observed trends when exploring this salary ratio?

Necessary Data: 
CEO Salaries, Median/Mean/Raw employee salaries, Raw Company Layoff Data, Industry Layoff Rates, Company Profits/Revenues, Industry Profits/Revenues

Questions we’ll ask of the data:
Does the CEO Salary to Median Employee Salary Ratio materially change across industries? Can specific industry factors explain a massive ratio? Does a lower ratio mean increased layoff rates?  Is there a relationship between CEO salary and the number of employees laid off? How does a company’s layoff rate compare to the industry average? How does the CEO salary compare to company profits/revenues?
